# Morning Light

*A poem*

The world holds its breath
in the tender moments before dawn,
when darkness loosens its grip
and light begins its gentle conquest.

A single bird sings—
just one voice in the vast silence,
announcing what we already know:
that night must yield to day,
that endings birth beginnings.

The coffee steams in my hands,
a small warmth against the morning chill,
as I watch the sky transform
from bruised purple to hopeful gold.

Each sunrise is a promise kept,
a reminder that we are given
another chance to begin again,
to write our stories in light
instead of shadow.

The dew on the grass catches the first rays,
tiny prisms holding entire worlds,
and I think perhaps this is enough:
to witness, to wonder, to welcome
the gift of another day.
